I chose React as the framework for this project and built the frontend using Vite for faster development and optimized builds. The entire React application is located in the [frontend](/frontend/) folder, where research topics such as React, Vite, and React Router have been applied throughout the codebase.
I have completed most of the functionality of the app. For the final milestone, I plan to focus on styling the application using `Tailwind CSS` and integrating `Chart.js` to create a bar chart for visualizing class-specific metrics.
