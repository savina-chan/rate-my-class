# RateMyClass

RateMyClass is a web application designed to help NYU students make informed decisions about their courses by providing detailed, student-generated reviews and ratings. Unlike platforms that focus solely on professor reviews, RateMyClass centers on the courses themselves, offering insights into aspects like difficulty, workload, and learning value. This focus allows students to evaluate courses based on past student experiences, enabling them to choose classes that best align with their academic goals and learning preferences.

Through RateMyClass, users can browse a dynamic catalog of classes, view aggregate ratings, and read detailed reviews. Registered users can create new class entries, contribute their own feedback, rate classes they've taken, and engage in a community of peers with similar academic interests. The platform's goal is to create a reliable and flexible resource for students navigating their academic options, fostering a more transparent and informed class selection process.
